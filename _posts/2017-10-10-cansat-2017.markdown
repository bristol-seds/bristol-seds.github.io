Following the success (and a bit of criticism) of the University's first CanSat contest in 2016, 
there was a lot of anticipation for the sequel. And now the wait is almost over! Once again organised with help from
[Aerospace Engineering Department](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/aerospace/) 
of the University of Bristol, the competition will give the selected teams three weeks to develop and produce their 
CanSats with the launch set to take place on the 18th of November.

To take part in the competition, the participants are to form into teams and 
submit their entry using [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/a/bristol.ac.uk/forms/d/1bd33Ri4-xkptwQZHbSmQPtdkWog1ebTV1O3XLTwD53o/edit?usp=sharing).
